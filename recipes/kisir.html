        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kisir is a popular Turkish bulgur salad known for its bright, refreshing flavors and colorful appearance. It’s made with fine bulgur wheat that’s softened with hot water, then mixed with tomato paste, olive oil, lemon juice, and a variety of fresh herbs such as parsley and mint. The result is a light yet satisfying dish that balances tangy, savory, and slightly spicy notes — perfect as a side, light lunch, or part of a mezze spread.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, kisir is served cold or at room temperature and often shared during family gatherings or friendly get-togethers. It’s especially beloved among Turkish women’s tea parties (gün) as a must-have snack alongside tea, stuffed grape leaves, and pastries. Its simplicity, versatility, and vibrant Mediterranean character make kisir not just a salad, but a symbol of Turkish home cooking and hospitality.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup fine bulgur wheat (köftelik bulgur)</li>
            <li>1 cup hot water (just enough to soften the bulgur)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste (or 1 tbsp tomato + 1 tbsp pepper paste for richer flavor)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses (nar ekşisi, optional but adds tanginess)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2–3 green onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber, diced (optional)</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato, diced (optional)</li>
            <li>½ bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>A few sprigs fresh mint (or 1 tsp dried mint)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (pul biber, to taste)</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves, for serving (optional but traditional for presentation)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soften the bulgur:</strong> Place the fine bulgur wheat in a large bowl. Pour 1 cup of hot water over it, cover the bowl with a lid or plate, and let it sit for 10–15 minutes until the grains absorb the water and become soft. Fluff it gently with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the flavor base:</strong> In a small pan, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over low heat. Add the tomato paste (and pepper paste if using) and stir for about 1–2 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat and pour this warm mixture over the softened bulgur. Mix thoroughly so the bulgur is evenly coated with the paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Add aromatics and seasonings:</strong> Stir in the lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, salt, and red pepper flakes. Use your hands or a spoon to mix well — gently kneading helps the flavors soak into the bulgur.</li>
            <li><strong>Add vegetables and herbs:</strong> Once the bulgur has cooled slightly, add the finely chopped onion, green onions, parsley, mint, and (if desired) the diced tomato and cucumber. Toss everything together until well combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Taste and adjust:</strong> Taste your kısır — add more lemon juice, salt, or red pepper flakes to your liking. The flavor should be tangy, slightly spicy, and fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the kısır cold or at room temperature, often on a bed of lettuce leaves or with lettuce cups for scooping. It pairs beautifully with Turkish tea or as part of a mezze platter alongside other dishes like yaprak sarma or sigara böreği.</li>
